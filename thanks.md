### Thanks to everyone
 
Clover is my first software, and I get hundreds of thousands of users after three months.
								 
We have also received a lot of letters, with bug report and suggestions. Many users spontaneously wrote blog to share Clover, we thanked here together, thank you!

We tried every means to promote technology applications, to make everybody's job easier, life better. 
We currently do not have any capital income, funding can help the subsequent development of Clover, donated funds will be used for hardware, software, hosting and other maintenance costs.
