Clover 1.0 was released at 6 June, in a month, without publicity, without promotion, had already reached 13,000 visits.

Many users give us bug feedback and suggestions, I received more than 500 messages in my mailbox. And I received a lot of thanks for our free software, thanks to you too, my users, This is the greatest affirmation to my work in the past few months.

Now have a more difficult problem, some users proposed to amend the product name, product icon, I have said in previous articles, thought out Clover, I've spent countless brain cells. Unless you help me come up with a better product name, product icon, otherwise I would not change ^ _ ^

If you have good ideas, good name or icon, <a href="mailto:achermao@gmail.com">please drop me an email</a>.
