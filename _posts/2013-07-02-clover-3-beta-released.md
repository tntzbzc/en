From early December 2012, I began the development of 3.0.
Because the theme feature and middle-click to open new tab was more complex,
So Clover 3.0 used nearly four months to develop.

During this time many users write to ask about the progress of the development. Finally I can release it now. 

Thanks for your waiting, I can also breathe a sigh of relief :)

Hope you will continue to support the Clover, help me to share Clover in blog, twitter, facebook...
